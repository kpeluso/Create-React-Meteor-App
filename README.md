# Meetr
> MMGA - Make Meetings Useful Again

## Description

Regardless if they ever were useful, they tend to not be these days. Meetr can help you ensure that your meetings are worthwhile.

Meetr was created off of the philosophy of *Rework* authors Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. According to them, meetings should abide by the following rules:

1. :white_check_mark: Respect a strict time limit.
2. :white_check_mark: Have as few people as possible.
3. :white_check_mark: Have a clear agenda.
4. :white_check_mark: End with a solution that holds people accountable for what they're tasked to implement.
5. :x: Begin with a specific problem.
6. :x: Meet at the problem site.

Meetr can help you abide by 4 of the 6 rules that should be imposed on meetings. We hope that you use Meetr (and hold meetings) only when you have a specific problem to tackle. We hope that when you meet, you meet at the source of the problem. Wherever that source may be, don't forget to take Meetr with you!
